					<h2 class="subtitles">Characters</h2>
				<aside>
					<blockquote><p>Characters are essential to any story. Good, believable characters are essential to helping the audience relate. They also help the movement of the story. How a character might react to a certain situation will affect where the story moves. Are they easily aggravated in stressful situations, or are they prone to make good judgement? Do they follow their heart or their head? Character development is also a significant part of the plotline and theme. In the first few chapters, your character might have anger issues that affect the way he or she might interact with other characters and affect the plot. However, in the end the character might have dealt with the anger issues and now is able to make sound judgement.

					<h4 class="subtitles"><em>Developing a Backstory</em></h4>
					<blockquote><p>A backstory is very important in how a character is developed. For example, how would an only child from a rich family act, talk, and think differently than a child with many siblings and a poor family? How would a pop star act differently than a war veteran? Although much of the backstory will not be included in the actual story, it makes the character more believable and makes it easier to put yourself in your character's shoes if you better understand where they came from and what they've been through.

						<section>
					<h4 class="subtitles"><em>Strengths and Weaknesses</em></h4>
					<blockquote><p>Another key part in making a good character is to think through their strengths and weaknesses. Certain characters must be good at certain things in order for the plot to make sense. For example, a war veteran might be good with firearms and could provide an element of defense. On the other hand, a pop star might have a lot of money and could provide an element of supplying. As for weaknesses, they usually go hand in hand with strengths. A war veteran might be good with firearms, but often will assume that the only way to solve a problem is with force. A pop star might have lots of money, but might be too proud of it and not think of spending it wisely, instead using their funds to show off. Weaknesses are just as important as strengths, as they open up possibilities for conflict and character development as well as help the audience relate.

			A good way to make very believable characters is to look at what makes real people their own personalities. You can read through this list of real-life personality types and determine what personality type you might want for your character: <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/personality-types" target="_blank">Myer Briggs Personalities</a>

				Here is another good way to look at character roles. The Hero's Journey Monomyth is a theory that all good stories include these roles.<br><br>
