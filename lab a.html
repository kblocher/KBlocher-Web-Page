				<blockquote><p>
					 Fictional writing is a rewarding hobby. Not only do authors get to express themselves through their stories, they get to expand their scope of creativity by exploring different characters, settings, themes, ideas, developments, and so much more. An added benefit to writing is the extra practice of the English language, which leads to a broader vocabulary and more ease in writing other projects such as essays or reports. For authors who do historical fiction, the added research put in to the period in which the story is can be helpful for learning more history. Writing is not just about telling a story. It is about creating a world, communicating ideas, and adding to personal learning in a fun and innovative way.

					<h3>Characters</h3>
				</header>
				<aside>
					<blockquote><p>Characters are essential to any story. Good, believable characters are essential to helping the audience relate. They also help the movement of the story. How a character might react to a certain situation will affect where the story moves. Are they easily aggravated in stressful situations, or are they prone to make good judgement? Do they follow their heart or their head? Character development is also a significant part of the plotline and theme. In the first few chapters, your character might have anger issues that affect the way he or she might interact with other characters and affect the plot. However, in the end the character might have dealt with the anger issues and now is able to make sound judgement.

					<h4><em>Developing a Backstory</em></h4>
					<blockquote><p>A backstory is very important in how a character is developed. For example, how would an only child from a rich family act, talk, and think differently than a child with many siblings and a poor family? How would a pop star act differently than a war veteran? Although much of the backstory will not be included in the actual story, it makes the character more believable and makes it easier to put yourself in your character's shoes if you better understand where they came from and what they've been through.

					<h4><em>Strengths and Weaknesses</em></h4>
					<blockquote><p>Another key part in making a good character is to think through their strengths and weaknesses. Certain characters must be good at certain things in order for the plot to make sense. For example, a war veteran might be good with firearms and could provide an element of defense. On the other hand, a pop star might have a lot of money and could provide an element of supplying. As for weaknesses, they usually go hand in hand with strengths. A war veteran might be good with firearms, but often will assume that the only way to solve a problem is with force. A pop star might have lots of money, but might be too proud of it and not think of spending it wisely, instead using their funds to show off. Weaknesses are just as important as strengths, as they open up possibilities for conflict and character development as well as help the audience relate.

					<h4><em>Role</em></h4>
					<blockquote><p>Every character has to play a role in the story. If you find that one of your characters isn't doing very much, its time to either rethink them or cut them out completely. Useless characters make things overly complicated and don't aid to moving the story along. Make sure your character absolutely has to do at least one important thing in the story.</p></blockquote>

				<section>
				<h4><em>Characteristics</em></h4>
				<blockquote><p>Now the fun part. What makes your character the person they are? What makes them think? Once you have a good grip on where they came from and what they're good at, make them relatable, believable, and fun. <strong>Dull characters drag down a story.</strong> Have them talk a certain way, look a certain way. Have your war veteran constantly smoke an old pipe and your pop star always use nicknames like <q>honey</q> or <q>babe</q>. Make them interesting. You know a character is good when you can't wait to see what they'll say or do next.</p></blockquote>
