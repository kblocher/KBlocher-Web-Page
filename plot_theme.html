     <h2 class="subtitles">Plot/Theme</h2>
     <blockquote><p>The plot or theme of the story is the main highway through which everything else flows. The plot is the fiber of the story, and without a good plot, everything else will fall apart. It is the backbone that holds up the idea you want to communicate. A good plot is both the start and the end of the planning process.
						</p></blockquote>
   </aside>
   
   <section><h4 class="subtitles"><em>Tying it All Together</em></h4>
	<blockquote><p>The characters, setting, and language may all be good, but they must all somehow be tied to the plot. This is where the theme comes in. The theme is the drive of the plot and the character development. Is it a coming of age story or a tragic love story? Think about your story as a fable or a proverb. If there was one takeaway from the story, what would it be? What is the moral of the story? Once you have discovered the theme of your story, everything falls into place, and you can begin writing towards that theme.
					</p></blockquote></section>
   
	<section><h4 class="subtitles"><em>Progression and Development</em></h4>
	<blockquote><p> During the plot, characters may develop and change over time. There always has to be big changes, and things that can never be revisited. With the plot, you take the reader on a journey from one place to a larger world. You broaden the scope of their imagination and you make them ponder their own world. A good plot will have the readers putting themselves in the shoes of the characters, or asking themselves what will happen to the characters after the story ends. But overall, it should leave the reader with a sense of satisfaction, that the theme was fully represented, that the characters grew and changed for the better or for the worse, and that the story now has a sense of fulfillment.
