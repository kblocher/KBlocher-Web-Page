					<h2 class="subtitles">Setting</h2>
				<aside>
					<blockquote><p>The setting of a story is a significant part of the story. The elements of the setting can include the time and place of your story, which builds upon the type of world your charcter lives in. Equally as important to stories as characters but often overlooked, a setting that is good can really make the story iconic and original.
						</p></blockquote>
				</aside>


				<section>
					<h4 class="subtitles"><em>How Does it Affect the Story</em></h4>
					<blockquote><p>The setting can greatly impact the way the story is told. First of all, what time period the setting is in can affect the way the characters talk, dress, and even add to the conflict and movement of the plot. Is it a medieval time period set in a castle or a low peasant village? The characters and the story might go differently in this setting than in a 1920's gangster slum in New York City.

				  <h4 class="subtitles"><em>Where to Find Inspiration</em></h4>
				  <blockquote><p>Where can inspiration for a good setting be found? This question can be answered by taking a close look at the characters and the story. When and where would the conflict best be played out? What era in history do you like the most, or are you more interested in futuristic or alternate dimension settings? Research always has to be taken into consideration, but when you are working on a setting in a time and place you are really interested in, the reasearch is more fun than work. If all fails, look around you. What parts of the world you live in inspire you the most? Take note of things, and find your own setting.
