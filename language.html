					<h2 class="subtitles">Language</h2>
				<aside>
					<blockquote><p>The language of the story is very key to the believability of both the story and the characters. First of all, the dialogue gives life to a character. It would be equally as strange for a cowboy to exclaim, "Forsooth and anon!" as it would for an emperor to casually "y'all" his subjects. Secondly, a good vocabulary can come in handy when describing how a character looks, an action scene is played out, and a setting is described.
						</p></blockquote>

					<h4 class="subtitles"><em>Describing Characters</em></h4>
					<blockquote><p>Imagine if someone were blind, and you had to describe how somebody else looked to them. As a writer, you can see your characters perfectly, but your readers are blind to what you see. Unless is it of no perceivable value to the story to describe how your characters look, it makes it easier for the reader to be involved in the story when they have an idea of the appearances of the characters. With this in mind, language becomes key when the writer is trying to portray an accurate picture. While an English gentleman might have a "clean-cut goatee," a Canadian lumberjack might be sporting a "scraggly beard." Likewise, someone might walk in a "rigidly poised march," while another might "saunter along candidly." Tell the reader who they are reading about, and give faces to otherwise faceless characters.
					</p></blockquote>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				  <h4 class="subtitles"><em>Describing a Scene</em></h4>
				  <blockquote><p> Again, your readers are unable to see what you see, so when a character steps into a scene, the only way the reader can see the scene is if the author describes it. There are lots of descriptive words that can be used to paint a picture of a scene, especially when the scene reflects the mood of the story. A "sleepy village," might indicate peace and tranquility, while a "thick fog drifting through the dark streets," of a large city might give the mood of mystery and danger and hint that something is about to happen.
				  </p></blockquote>
				</section>
				
				<section>
				  <h4 class="subtitles"><em>Describing Action</em></h4>
				  <blockquote><p>Another aspect of descriptive language is describing action. Whether it's something as large as scene action, something as ongoing as story movement, or something small as body language, describing what is happening is very key. For intense action scenes, descriptive words are very important to portray the tension of the scene. Where someone "stood up," from a parlor couch, he might have conversely "sprang up," to run and aid a friend. Again, research words and synonyms to make the language colorful.
